The code team is researching the python coding for different GUI tools. They reviewed the sketches and workflow projects submitted by class members for ideas. They chose to research the following tools: checkbox, chooser(drop down menu), entry, message editor, label, push button, range and tab widget. We will discuss findings next meeting.
