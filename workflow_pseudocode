# Add your pseudocode to this file!
# I included a starter workflow based on fhouyang's IMG_4020.jpg upload. Please integrate elements from other workflows, as well.
# It might be helpful to include a list of which workflows we have integrated so far. (So I will start a list.)

# Workflows integrated so far:
# IMG_4020.jpg (from fhouyang)
# Riegel_GNU Diagram 1.jpg (from julieriegel - in "Interaction IX" folder)
# Riegel_GNU Diagram 2.jpg (from julieriegel - in "Interaction IX" folder)
# ## ^^Please add to this list above if you integrate another workflow! ##

# Welcome screen/SDR selection:
"Radio 1" (button for SDR selection): command = selectSDR (see selectSDR function definition below)
"Radio 2" (button for SDR selection): command = selectSDR
"Radio 3" (button for SDR selection): command = selectSDR
"Radio 4" (button for SDR selection): command = selectSDR
# ^This workflow did not integrate a "next" button, but other workflows do include one, so I am going ahead and putting it here:
"Next" (button for confirming selection and moving to next screen): command = confirmSDR

Function: selectSDR
sdrName = #get name of SDR selected by user (e.g. hackRF)
#change the style of the "Radio 1"/"Radio 2"/etc. button that the user clicked on 
  #to reflect the SDR option that they selected. (E.g. Go from a "Raised" button style to a "Sunken" button style.)

Function: confirmSDR
If SDR is selected:
  #set device to sdrName....wherever it's needed for the next steps?
  #move to next screen of Wizard
else (i.e. no SDR selected; user clicked "next" without choosing any radio):
  display message: "Please select a radio."
