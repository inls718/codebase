# Add your pseudocode to this file!
# I included a starter workflow based on fhouyang's IMG_4020.jpg upload. Please integrate elements from other workflows, as well.
# It might be helpful to include a list of which workflows we have integrated so far. (So I will start a list.)

# Workflows integrated so far:
# IMG_4020.jpg (from fhouyang)
# ## ^^Please add to this list above if you integrate another workflow! ##

# Welcome screen/SDR selection:
"Radio 1" (button for SDR selection): command = selectSDR (see selectSDR function definition below)
"Radio 2" (button for SDR selection): command = selectSDR
"Radio 3" (button for SDR selection): command = selectSDR
"Radio 4" (button for SDR selection): command = selectSDR

Function: selectSDR
sdrName = #get name of SDR selected by user (e.g. hackRF)
#change the style of the "Radio 1"/"Radio 2"/etc. button that the user clicked on 
  #to reflect the SDR option that they selected. (E.g. Go from a "Raised" button style to a "Sunken" button style.)
